## Installation

Pmteor is made with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com). Thus the easiest way to
start hacking is by installing the framework, cloning the git repository, and
launching the application:

```bash
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh # On Mac or Linux
$ git clone https://github.com/pmteor/pmteor.git
$ cd pmteor
$ meteor npm install
$ meteor
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and please login.

As for any Meteor application, Pmteor is automatically refreshed when you change
any file of the source code, just play with it to see how it behaves!

## Style guide

We follow the
[meteor style guide](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Style-Guide).

Please read the meteor style guide before making any significant contribution.
